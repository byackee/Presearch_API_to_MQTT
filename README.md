# Presearch_API_to_MQTT
Send Presearch API to MQTT (with Home Assistant discovery)

# Limitation
  Presearch API Request Rate Limits:
    * Requests without stats (default, stats=false): Up to 4 requests per minute
    * Requests with stats (stats=true): Up to 4 requests per hour

## Requirements:
  * Python3 & pip3
  * module paho-mqtt (pip3 install paho-mqtt)

## Utilisation:
  1) In both file presearch-discovery.py & presearch.py, modify mqtt variable for connect your broker (ip, port, user, port)
  2) Launch 1 time script "python3 presearch-discovery.py your_api_token"
  3) Create cron (every minute) to run scrupt "python3 presearch.py your_api_token

## How its work:
With your cron the script give the main data from presearch API and every 15 minutes add stats data (limited to 4 requests per hour) and send all to your MQTT broker.
